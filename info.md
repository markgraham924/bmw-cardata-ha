## This is experimental. 🐼
## Taken over since no response for original developper -> this wil me be bug fixing, some extra features but mostly bugs, i'm taking this over cause i like fixing bugs but dont have the time to ad complete new featers PR are welcome

Not required but appreciated :)

I'm developing this on my free time with personal use cases as highest priority. Main goal was to get it running ASAP when BMW killed the old API, so the code quality wasn't priority at all. So far the plugin has been surprisingly stable even after bigger (AI Agent assisted) edits, but there's always a risk that something falls through, due to nonexistent automatic testing and me not doing a completely fresh install every time I test a new feature.
^^^^^^
🐼
Releases might go hard in the beginning as i have different view over the plugin so might be breakage when upgrading :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Beta branch is used as a day to day development branch and can contain completely broken stuff, please don't use it or report bugs from it unless specifically asked for. The main branch is updated when I feel that it works well enough and has something worth to publish.

## Issues / Discussion
Please try to post only issues relevant to the integration itself on the [Issues](https://github.com/kvanbiesen/bmw-cardata-ha/issues) and keep all the outside discussion (problems with registration on BMWs side, asking for guidance, etc)

### Configure button actions
On the integration main page, there is now "Configure" button. You can use it to:
- Refresh authentication tokens (will reload integration, might also need HA restart in some problem cases)
- Start device authorization again (redo the whole auth flow. Not tested yet but should work ™️)

And manual API calls, these should be automatically called when needed, but if it seems that your device names aren't being updated, it might be worth it to run these manually. 
- Initiate Vehicles API call (Fetch all Vehicle VINS on your account and create entities out of them)
- Get Basic Vehicle Information (Fetches vehicle details like model, etc. for all known VINS)
- Get telematics data (Fetches a telematics data from the CarData API. This is a limited hardcoded subset compared to stream. I can add more if needed)

Note that every API call here counts towards your 50/24h quota!


Turn your BMW CarData stream into native Home Assistant entities. This integration subscribes directly to the BMW CarData MQTT stream, keeps the token fresh automatically, and creates sensors/binary sensors for every descriptor that emits data.

**IMPORTANT: I released this to public after verifying that it works on my automations, so the testing time has been quite low so far. If you're running any critical automations, please don't use this plugin yet.**

> **Note:** This entire plugin was generated with the assistance of AI to quickly solve issues with the legacy implementation. The code is intentionally open—to-modify, fork, or build a new integration from it. PRs are welcome unless otherwise noted in the future.

> **Tested Environment:** The integration has only been verified on my own outdated Home Assistant instance (2024.12.5). Newer releases might require adjustments.

> **Heads-up:** I've tested this on 2022 i4 and 2016 i3. Both show up entities, i4 sends them instantly after locking/closing the car remotely using MyBMW app. i3 seems to send the data when it wants to. So far after reinstalling the plugin, I haven't seen anything for an hour, but received data multiple times earlier. So be patient, maybe go and drive around or something to trigger the data transfer :) 

## BMW Portal Setup (DON'T SKIP, DO THIS FIRST)

The CarData web portal isn’t available everywhere (e.g., it’s disabled in Finland). You can still enable streaming by logging in by using supported region. It doesn't matter which language you select - all the generated Id and configuration is shared between all of them. 

### BMW 

- https://www.bmw.co.uk/en-gb/mybmw/vehicle-overview (in English)
- https://www.bmw.de/de-de/mybmw/vehicle-overview (in German)

### Mini

- https://www.mini.co.uk/en-gb/mymini/vehicle-overview (in English)
- https://www.mini.de/de-de/mymini/vehicle-overview (in German)

1. Select the vehicle you want to stream.
2. Choose **BMW CarData** or **Mini CarData**.
3. Generate a client ID as described here: https://bmw-cardata.bmwgroup.com/customer/public/api-documentation/Id-Technical-registration_Step-1
4. Under section CARDATA API, you see **Client ID**. Copy this to your clipboard because you will need it during **Configuration Flow** in Home Assistant.
5. Now select Request access to CarData API and CarData Stream.
   Note, BMW portal seems to have some problems with scope selection. If you see an error on the top of the page, reload it, select one scope and wait for +30 seconds, then select the another one and wait agin.
6. Don't press the button Authenticate device
7. Scroll down to **CARDATA STREAMING** and press **Configure data stream** and on that new page, load all descriptors (keep clicking “Load more”).
8. Manually check every descriptor you want to stream or optionally to automate this, open the browser console and run:
```js
(() => {
  const labels = document.querySelectorAll('.css-k008qs label.chakra-checkbox');
  let changed = 0;

  labels.forEach(label => {
    const input = label.querySelector('input.chakra-checkbox__input[type="checkbox"]');
    if (!input || input.disabled || input.checked) return;

    label.click();
    if (!input.checked) {
      const ctrl = label.querySelector('.chakra-checkbox__control');
      if (ctrl) ctrl.click();
    }
    if (!input.checked) {
      input.checked = true;
      ['click', 'input', 'change'].forEach(type =>
        input.dispatchEvent(new Event(type, { bubbles: true }))
      );
    }
    if (input.checked) changed++;
  });

  console.log(`Checked ${changed} of ${labels.length} checkboxes.`);
})();
```
   - If you want the "Extrapolated SOC" helper sensor to work, make sure your telematics container includes the descriptors `vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.header`, `vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.maxEnergy`, `vehicle.powertrain.electric.battery.charging.power`, and `vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.status`. Those fields let the integration reset the extrapolated state of charge and calculate the charging slope between stream updates.

9. Save the selection.
10. Repeat for all the cars you want to support
11. In Home Assistant, install this integration via HACS (see below under Installation (HACS)) and still in Home Assistant, step trough the Configuration Flow also described here below.
12. During the Home Assistant config flow, paste the client ID, visit the provided verification URL, enter the code (if asked), and approve. **Do not click Continue/Submit in Home Assistant until the BMW page confirms the approval**; submitting early leaves the flow stuck and requires a restart.
13. Wait for the car to send data—triggering an action via the MyBMW app (lock/unlock doors) usually produces updates immediately.

## Installation (HACS)

1. Add this repo to HACS as a **custom repository** (type: Integration).
2. Install "BimmerData Streamline" from the Custom section.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration Flow

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and pick **BimmerData Streamline**.
2. Enter your CarData **client ID** (created in the BMW portal and seen under section CARDATA API and there copied to your clipboard).
3. The flow displays a `verification_url` and `user_code`. Open the link, enter the code, and approve the device.
4. Once the BMW portal confirms the approval, return to HA and click Submit. If you accidentally submit before finishing the BMW login, the flow will hang until the device-code exchange times out; cancel it and start over after completing the BMW login.
5. If you remove the integration later, you can re-add it with the same client ID—the flow deletes the old entry automatically.

### Reauthorization
If BMW rejects the token (e.g. because the portal revoked it), please use the Configure > Start Device Authorization Again tool

## Entity Naming & Structure

- Each VIN becomes a device in HA (`VIN` pulled from CarData).
- Sensors/binary sensors are auto-created and named from descriptors (e.g. `Cabin Door Row1 Driver Is Open`).
- Additional attributes include the source timestamp.

## Debug Logging
Set `DEBUG_LOG = True` in `custom_components/cardata/const.py` for detailed MQTT/auth logs (enabled by default). To reduce noise, change it to `False` and reload HA.

## Developer Tools Services

Home Assistant's Developer Tools expose helper services for manual API checks:

- `cardata.fetch_telematic_data` fetches the current contents of the configured telematics container for a VIN and logs the raw payload.
- `cardata.fetch_vehicle_mappings` calls `GET /customers/vehicles/mappings` and logs the mapping details (including PRIMARY or SECONDARY status). Only primary mappings return data; some vehicles do not support secondary users, in which case the mapped user is considered the primary one.
- `cardata.fetch_basic_data` calls `GET /customers/vehicles/{vin}/basicData` to retrieve static metadata (model name, series, etc.) for the specified VIN.
- `migrations` call for proper renaming the sensors from old installations

## Requirements

- BMW CarData account with streaming access (CarData API + CarData Streaming subscribed in the portal).
- Client ID created in the BMW portal (see "BMW Portal Setup").
- Home Assistant 2024.6+.
- Familiarity with BMW’s CarData documentation: https://bmw-cardata.bmwgroup.com/customer/public/api-documentation/Id-Introduction

## Known Limitations

- Only one BMW stream per GCID: make sure no other clients are connected simultaneously.
- The CarData API is read-only; sending commands remains outside this integration.
- Premature Continue in auth flow: If you hit Continue before authorizing on BMW’s site, the device-code flow gets stuck. Cancel the flow and restart the integration (or Home Assistant) once you’ve completed the BMW login.
