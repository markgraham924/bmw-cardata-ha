        BMW does not always send phaseNumber for a charge, and the value it left
        behind from the previous one is discarded as stale, so the session falls
        back to a single phase.  On a three phase charge that understates the
        power by a factor of three and every estimate built on it.

        The battery gives the answer away.  Inverting the model that produced the
        prediction says how many phases the energy stored would have needed:

            phases = m x (stored / efficiency + auxiliary) / gross modelled

        where m is the multiplier the model has been applying over the window.
        Comparing gross to gross matters: measuring both sides after auxiliary
        load is deducted biases the answer upward, worst at low current, which is
        the direction that would wrongly call a charge three phase.

        Auxiliary energy comes from the difference between the two accumulators
        rather than from elapsed time, so a capped gap in the integration is
        reflected on both sides instead of inventing energy that was never
        counted.  The window opens once energy tracking is running, so a late
        first power reading cannot masquerade as extra gain.  The efficiency is
        the fixed default rather than the learned figure, which is itself keyed on
        the phase count and would feed the guess back into its own input.

        Only used where the evidence is unambiguous, and it takes two windows in
        a row to act, because rounding and stalled integration can each carry a
        single window over the line but neither repeats reliably.

        Withdrawing an inferred count re-anchors the prediction to the BMW reading
        that disproved it.  Putting the phase count back would otherwise fix the
        rate while leaving the level: energy banked under the wrong multiplier
        stays in the accumulator, and during a charge the prediction never comes
        down of its own accord.

        A session reloaded from disk is judged too, unlike learning.  Each verdict
        rests on what was gathered since the window opened, which is after the
        reload, so the gaps that make a restored session unfit to learn from do
        not reach it.  Barring them would freeze an inferred count with no way
